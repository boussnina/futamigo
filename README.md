# futamigo ⚽

a small football platform i started during the last year of my studies. the idea was to track match results, scrape player data, and build some fun mini games and prediction tools.

## features

- flask backend using SQLAlchemy and MySQL
- react frontend (included in the repo)
- player search endpoint: `/futl/<player_name>`
- random player generator: `/randPlayer`
- scraper that collects player data from top leagues like premier league, la liga, and bundesliga

## notes

- database is hosted on hostinger  
- scraper is built with python and returns structured JSON  
- still a work in progress — planning to expand it with predictions and mini games  
- mostly made to have fun with football data and explore fullstack development
